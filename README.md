# Togglae for Gather Town

This extension allows control your audio in the Gather Town by shortcut keys.

The default shortcut is `Shift + Alt + Q`, but you can change it in the settings and use your own.

This command is available when you are in browser focus, but I personly encorage you to use the global control, and you can set it in browser settings.
